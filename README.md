# Machine Learning Specialization with DeepLEarning.AI and Stanford University
Here are some of the labs that I made in the ML specialization.

## Multiclass Classification:
Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (multiclass_classification.ipynb)

## Advice for Applying Machine Learning:
Explore techniques to evaluate and improve machine learning models (models.ipynb)

## K-Means:
Implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression (k-means.ipynb)

## Reinforcement Learning:
Train an agent to land a lunar lander safely on a landing pad on the surface of the moon (reinforcement_learning.ipynb)
